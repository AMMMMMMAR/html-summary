# HTML Summary Project

## Overview

This project is a **personal HTML handbook** that I built while learning HTML.  
Instead of writing notes on paper, I created this website — where each HTML topic has its own page.  
It serves as both a **learning project** and a **reference guide** for me (and anyone else learning HTML).

---

## Features

- **Homepage (`index.html`)** — organized navigation for all topics
- **Topic Pages** — each HTML concept is explained in its own page:
  - Head Elements
  - Body & Text Formatting
  - Lists
  - Links & Media (Images, Audio, Video)
  - Forms
  - Tables
  - Semantic HTML
- **Assets Folder** — structured storage for images, media, and documents

---

## What I Used in This Project

- I practiced with **most of the common HTML tags**.
- Each HTML page focuses on a **specific subject**, explaining:
  - Which tags are related to that subject
  - How to use them with examples
- This makes the project a **practical study guide** for learning HTML step by step.
